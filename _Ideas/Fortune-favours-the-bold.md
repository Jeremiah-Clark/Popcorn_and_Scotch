The phrase “fortune favors the bold” is an interesting one. Usually spoken as an encouragement to do something risky, because that way lies greatness. The thing is, that phrase was famously (originally?) spoken by Pleni the Elder to his son. As he sailed towards an erupting Mount Vesuvius in an attempt to mount a rescue. The mountain claimed him that day.
