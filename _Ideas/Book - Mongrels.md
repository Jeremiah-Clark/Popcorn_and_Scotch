Visceral and violent, a story of low class Gothic horror set on the highways and in the small towns of the modern day southern united states. 
Itâ€™s interesting that some of the werewolves they run across are living fairly normal lives, something they seem to think is impossible. 
At the end his brother embraces the human world, his sister the wolf world, seemingly the opposite of their outlooks. 
At the same time, he begins his life straddling both worlds (happily?).
