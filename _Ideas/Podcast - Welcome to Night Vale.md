# Welcome to Night Vale

I’ve recently stumbled across Welcome to Night Vale. It appears I’m late to another party; it has been running since 2012. If you’re not familiar, it’s a strange podcast in the form of a community radio show from the fictional town of Night Vale. The writing is sharp, at times hypnotic, and the delivery is fantastic. The story is, at turns, terrifying and absurd. The world-building is like trying to describe the geography of a dream.

It’s as if Twin Peaks were a podcast. A podcast written by Neil Gaiman channeling Stephen King and Garrison Keillor as HP Lovecraft deliriously screams ideas and eldritch chants in the next room.

Totally my jam.

By way of example, the show segments run from the chaotic and absurd…

> Friends, listeners, there’s a real tarantula problem here in Night Vale. Many residents have called in to report that illiteracy, unwanted pregnancy, and violent crime are on the rise in the tarantula communities. Animal control is addressing these concerns through after-school programs called “Teach a Spider to Read: Stop the Madness.” Those interested in volunteering should stand in their bathtubs and weep until it is all gone. Nothing left. You can let go now. Let go. Sssh. Let go.

… to the oddly poignant…

> \[…\] importantly: all of us, all of us here in Night Vale, in America, in the world, in the secret orbital bases, all of us got through another day. We passed the time, from one end of twelve to the other, without stopping once. Well done, us. Good job, people who experience time. Time experiencers, good job.
> 
> And, from this moment in history, the one that’s happening right now, goodnight.

… social commentary…

> No citizen is above paying taxes. Well, except Marcus Vanston, but that’s understandable because he’s so wealthy. When you’re worth as much as Marcus Vanston, you have proved your value to society through hard work and determination and are no longer required to show anyone any further proof that you care about anything or anybody else, because you obviously do. Look at all your money.

To the downright philosophical

> \[…\] to get personal for a moment, I think the best way to die would be swallowed by a giant snake. Going feet first and whole into a slimy maw would give your life perfect symmetry.

> Here are this week’s horoscopes.
>
>\[…\]
>
> Aries: You will feel a haunting sadness about times gone by. Today’s smell is wheatgrass and toast.
> 
> \[…\]
> 
> Gemini: You will meet someone today who will have no effect on your life and who you will immediately forget. Retain hope for a possible future.

I could keep going forever; every episode is one gem after another. Those examples are from the first dozen or so episodes. They’re up to episode 192 as I write this.

If any of this appeals to you, I can’t recommend it enough.

> **PS:** The radio show format reminds me of the framing device in another favorite podcast, The Alexandria Archives. I have a thing for fiction that casually rides that line between the real, the macabre, the absurd.

> The meat of The Alexandria Archives was anthology horror in the Lovecraftian mode. It concluded in 2019, and I still miss it.
