Internet trolls love to pile on contentious comment threads and berate the original poster, or even earlier commenters, for not “engaging” with them. 
As if not getting into it with every dick on the internet invalidates your point.
I make a point of not reading comments in most cases.
Not because I’m not willing to debate and consider opposing view points, but because I don’t care what most of the kinds of people who yell at others on the internet think.
I’ll make my point and be done with it.
A quick scan of the comments is usually enough to determine if anyone is worth responding to, and the rest are free to rage vomit all over themselves, by themselves.
I have better things to do.
