## The Idea

I shouldn’t need to remind anyone that 2020 was… A year. Some time in there, I decided to end my already limited social media presence. That was fine for a while. I had friends and family and a new job full of people that I enjoyed communicating with.

That was enough for a while. After a time, I found I had things I wanted to say. More to the point, that I wanted to put out into the wider world. Whether anyone would listen wasn’t the point, I felt the need to express myself. And so, this blog.

There is no particular topic or subject matter. It’s whatever I want to talk about at any given time. I’m going to keep posts short, aiming for 500 words or less. This isn’t a hard and fast rule, just a reasonable goal to keep me going.

#### About The Name

After my wife and I discovered that we liked scotch, we started watching movies (at home) with a bag of popcorn and a little scotch. I liked the juxtaposition of the childish and the adult. The innocent and the worldly (for certain values of worldly). It struck me as a good summation of my interests. I tucked the name away for a few years until I decided to start blogging again, and here we are.

## Who Am I?

No one in particular. I’m a professional artist; I work in mobile games, doing 3D, game art, graphic design, and UI work. My interests range further than that. I read voraciously (mostly audiobooks, there’s so much to read, and I’m a slow reader), I play board, card, and video games. And I write. One of the reasons I write is to learn new things. It’s rare I don’t have a notebook (or a notes app) at hand to take notes, record links, and jot down thoughts.

As you’ll find, I also have a lot of thoughts and opinions.
