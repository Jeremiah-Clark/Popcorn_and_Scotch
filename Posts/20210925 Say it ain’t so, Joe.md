# Say it ain’t so, Joe

{>|} ![](_attachments/OhJoe.jpg)

I do hope Joe Rogan recovers from COVID soon. He needs to get back to handing out dangerous medical advice and decrying how hard life is for straight white dudes.

> **PS:** At least he finally let go of the **moon landing hoax**. Though not before trying to debate Phil Plait and Neil Degrasse Tyson about it. He’s that guy we all know who’s smart enough to argue his views but dumb enough to not realize he’s wrong about most of it.
